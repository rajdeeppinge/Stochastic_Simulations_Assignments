Interpretation of results of question 4

Since the process is a Martingale, 
it is expected that the proportion of white balls (Mn) remains same for all time steps.

We perform the experiment for 100 time steps. 
The experiment is performed a large number of times to remove the stochastic effect.

The average of the proportion of white balls at each time step is taken and plotted w.r.t time.

From the graph q4_Mn.jpg, we observe that the proportion of white balls remains same for all time steps.
This verifies the theoretical expectation.

Note: Graph q4_Mn_without_ensemble.jpg has fluctuations.
This is because the experiment has been performed only once. 
Therefore it may have probabilistic effect of choosing uniform random variable which may not have been eliminated.
